## Gradio Space Setup (Hugging Face)

- https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference
- https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-github-actions
- https://git-lfs.com/

```shell
git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/pkiage/scripture-semantic-search

git push --force space main
```
- When [syncing with Hugging Face via Github Actions](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-github-actions) the [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) created on Hugging Face (HF) should have write access
- Run space from main branch since running from [other branches currently isn't suppported](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/is-it-possible-to-run-apps-off-of-non-main-branches-in-a-space/18086)
- Ensure integrate remote changes (git pull) before push to HF space (```git push --force space main```)

## Git LFS
```shell
 git lfs track "*.parquet" "*.pkl" "*.json"
 ```
